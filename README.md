## Optimization of mathematical problems and electrical systems
This project is based on two approaches. The first approach is the numerical optimization (minimization/maximization) of a mathematical function or a set of functions (multi-objective optimization). The second approach is the application of optimization for controlling an electrical system (e.g. power system)  

Here model predictive control approach can be used for the controlling of the electrical system. 

##### Mathematical problem
Here minimization of a set of functions is performed. Minimization is achieved based on the setpoints. 

##### Electrical system
Here an electrical power system is used as the system model.
